# IFWand

This plugin is built for Paper 1.19.2 servers, it may work on other versions but it is untested.

This plugin allows you to lock Item Frames so the items cant be removed, not rotated, using a wand. If the plugin is removed, the Locked Item Frames will stay locked,

You can get the wand by using the command /ifwand (requires the IFWand.wand permission) or the command which was set in the config.

In order to lock an Item Frame, hold the wand in your hand and hit the Item Frame. If successful, it should say "Locked Item Frame" in the chat. Click again or destroy it in creative mode to unlock it.
