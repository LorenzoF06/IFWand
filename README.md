# IFWand

This plugin is built for paper 1.19.2 servers, it may work on other versions but it is untested.

this plugin allows you to lock item frames so the items cant be removed, not rotated, using a wand.

because this plugin only applies vanilla entity tags, even if the plugin is removed the item frames will stay locked

you can get the wand by using the command /ifwand (requires the IFWand.wand permission)

in order to lock an item frame, hold the wand in your hand and hit the item frame

if successful it should say "Item frame locked" in the chat

in order to remove a locked item frame a creative mode player must destroy it.
