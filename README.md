# IFWand

This plugin is built for Paper 1.19.2 up to 1.20.4. It may work on other versions but it is untested.

This plugin allows you to lock Item Frames so the items can't be removed or rotated by using a wand. If the plugin is removed, all the locked Item Frames will stay locked.

You can get the wand by using the command "/ifwand" (requires the "ifwand.wand" permission) or the command which was set in the config.

To lock an Item Frame, hold the wand in your hand and use it on the Item Frame. If successful, it should say "Locked Item Frame". Click again to unlock it or destroy it in creative mode.
